I'm currently a senior software engineer at One Medical, focusing on patient preventative care and health data security. In my free time I like to read sci-fi and fantasy books (currently reading [The Stormlight Archive](https://www.brandonsanderson.com/pages/the-stormlight-archive-series) 😁) and go fishing to get outside. As a new homeowner and soon-to-be dad, I've also been spending a lot of time learning about lawn care. Please reach out and connect with me! I love meeting with new folks to hear their experiences.
