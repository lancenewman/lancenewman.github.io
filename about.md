# Hi, I'm Lance Newman

I started this blog as a place to slow down, think out loud, and keep track of the things that shape my life. It's a home for whatever I'm curious about at the moment. You'll find a mix of lifestyle posts, personal reflections, and deep dives into the things I love: software engineering, gaming, photography, fitness, and all of the other interests that grab my attention.

Fair warning: the content I'm putting here is honest, open, and occasionally a little irreverent. There will be cursing, honest opinions, and hot takes. The views are my own and have no affiliation with any of my employers, past, present, or future.

I'm writing mostly for myself, but if you enjoy honest notes about learning, building, and experimenting, you might get some value out of following along. I don't have a regular posting schedule, but I try to get my thoughts down fairly consistently.

Thanks for reading!
